Since the name changed and it doesn’t mention anywhere it is append-only, I dismissed it two or three times during my tries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day, I was looking at alternative for gcc and clang. I clicked around github, sourcehut and gitlab READMEs to find \u003ca href=\"https://www.simple-cc.org/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003escc\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rui314/chibicc\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003echibicc\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://git.sr.ht/~mcf/cproc\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ecproc\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/larmel/lacc\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003elacc\u003c/a\u003e. Most of them look like high quality hobbyist projects, which are my favorite kind of projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I find insanely high quality hobbyist projects hidden in comments on Lobste.rs, the orange website or Reddit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen looking for these types of high quality hobbyist projects, github is not always the solution. Some are hosted on sourcehut, gitlab or codeberg. But sometimes, you can also find some isolated gitlab or gitea instances. It is very hard to search these platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this usecases, Duckduckgo and Google are literally useless. I’m looking for an alternative to Ansible right now, the results are filled with Search-Engine-Optimized articles that list the same thing “Puppet”, “CFEngine”, “Chef”. I’m not looking for this, I’m looking for some person in their garage who decided: “I think all of this sucks, I will do my own!”, kinda like ziglang started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have a secret technique or website of which I’m not aware? Or does it suck as well for you, and you just spend hours clicking around and bookmarking websites?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start really wondering how these Lobste.rs/Reddit comments find these projects…\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bgsuwg/how_do_you_find_your_software_tools","submitter_user":{"username":"acatton","created_at":"2015-02-13T18:54:10.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm just a software engineer who likes his job.\r\n\r\nI'm currently a Site Reliability Engineer at Google, Inc.\r\n\r\n**Opinions are my own, and NOT the views of my current or past employers**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/acatton","is_moderator":false,"karma":352,"avatar_url":"/avatars/acatton-100.png","invited_by_user":"csantosb"},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"gmbemz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gmbemz","created_at":"2021-01-19T19:57:52.000-06:00","title":"Command PATH security in Go","url":"https://blog.golang.org/path-security","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gmbemz/command_path_security_go","submitter_user":{"username":"adsouza","created_at":"2015-05-03T18:35:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a software engineer at Google who works in Go.
