I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, responsive, and modern websites. My focus is on delivering the best experience for users on every device. Making faster, lighter, and more secure sites using Wordpress or Static Page Generators is my specialty. When I am not coding, I like to write new articles on my blog.\r\n\r\nsilvestar.codes","is_moderator":false,"karma":162,"avatar_url":"/avatars/starbist-100.png","invited_by_user":"awal","github_username":"maliMirkec","twitter_username":"malimirkeccita"},"tags":["css"]},{"short_id":"zlwgmm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zlwgmm","created_at":"2021-03-14T09:48:51.000-05:00","title":"Why are Climate models written in programming languages from 1950?","url":"https://partee.io/2021/02/21/climate-model-response/","score":38,"flags":0,"comment_count":30,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zlwgmm/why_are_climate_models_written","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":73789,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["fortran","science"]},{"short_id":"tfwxiq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tfwxiq","created_at":"2021-03-15T08:39:47.000-05:00","title":"Towards a new general dispatch mechanism in MoarVM","url":"https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/03/15/towards-a-new-general-dispatch-mechanism-in-moarvm/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tfwxiq/towards_new_general_dispatch_mechanism","submitter_user":{"username":"uzl","created_at":"2021-02-26T15:27:56.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":36,"avatar_url":"/avatars/uzl-100.png","invited_by_user":"skuzzymiglet"},"tags":["compilers","programming"]}]
