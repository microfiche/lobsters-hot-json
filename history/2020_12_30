Performance is close to that of the STL, and I’ve included a couple use cases like a small 6502 compiler and a JSON parser. Using a CTL container is pretty simple. A type T is defined (and consumed) by a container inclusion, which in turns unlocks function signatures for that type and container:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e#define P\n#define T int\n#include \u0026lt;vec.h\u0026gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    vec_int a = vec_int_init();\n    vec_int_push_back(\u0026amp;a, 42);\n    ...\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory ownership with custom types is supported too: just declare a free and copy function for the type prior to including the container and type definition.

Many years later, when he had plenty of computer time, Serge still wrote out new programs on paper before typing them into the machine. “In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes,” he said. “When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in ways that minimized the amount of debugging. And so you had to think about it a lot before you committed it to paper. . . . The ready availability of computer time creates this mode of working where you just have an idea and type it and maybe erase it ten times.
