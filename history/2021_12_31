anything else, but I think the topic is not very explored and quite suits the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôve got my inspiration from quite a few discussions on IRC, including \u003ccode\u003e#lobsters\u003c/code\u003e. And I‚Äôm also at a process of designing some elaborate cross-platform TUI app, but this isn‚Äôt a direct call for recommendations on that certain project since my own goals are somewhat different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in this post I would like to ask you: \u003cstrong\u003edo you know any complete, powerful libraries or fameworks which can help someone build a complex TUI application using similar approach as GUI toolkits?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúbare bones‚Äù libraries to manipulate terminal state such as the only and one \u003ca href=\"https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003encurses\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/nsf/termbox\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003etermbox\u003c/a\u003e or even mighty \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003enotcurses\u003c/a\u003e. And for most determined people the ‚Äúbuild your own set of controls‚Äù approach is completely okay, but I think there might be some higher level options. Especially helpful for people who already have some libraries to do their actual stuff, but might look for frontend options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePersonal ramblings below, just my own take, not to alter anyone‚Äôs opinions or answers\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we‚Äôre taking an account on my personal taste, I‚Äôm generally more looking towards ‚Äúmore information, less decoration‚Äù stuff and I think the best comparison here is \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003espotify-tui\u003c/a\u003e vs \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003encspot\u003c/a\u003e. The first one is very much like a webdev person (no offence at all) would create a TUI - very boxy, lots of dings and still gets somewhat noisy and overloaded at times. The ncspot is pure information with little, neat bits of decoration and yet it maintains to be more readable IMO. In this territory, my favourite application is \u003ca href=\"http://weechat.org\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eweechat\u003c/a\u003e - highly configurable, every renderable ‚Äúitem‚Äù has to be composed from information source, the default divides terminal with different panel background colors and vertical lines where needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I have nothing against more ‚Äúvisualized‚Äù approaches as long as they‚Äôre done in a good way, since I really love \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003emidnight commander\u003c/a\u003e with all its menus, windows and popups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs even a step further than that with Turbo Vision which was the foundation for old Borland products like \u003ca href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/c/c8/Turbo_Pascal_7.1.png\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eTurbo Pascal\u003c/a\u003e and was very capable with layered window system, lots of widgets and very intuitive user approach.

By introducing the notion of secret paragraphs and commands in the models, it also allows the distribution and automatic evaluation of simple specification challenges, a useful mechanism that enables students to learn relational logic at their own pace. Alloy4Fun stores all versions of shared and analyzed models, as well as derivation trees that depict how those models evolved over time: this wealth of information can be mined by researchers or tutors to identify, for example, learning breakdowns in the class or typical mistakes made by students and other Alloy users. A beta version of Alloy4Fun was already used in two formal methods courses, and we present some results of this preliminary evaluation.‚Äù\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xceayc/sharing_learning_alloy_on_web_2019","submitter_user":{"username":"hcs","created_at":"2021-11-29T19:59:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Hi, I'm Adam Gashlin.
