Usingt hese pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the arton a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask:How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmen-tal and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sd1j3w/on_dangers_stochastic_parrots_can","submitter_user":{"username":"dgold","created_at":"2019-04-02T08:59:41.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":136,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dgold-100.png","invited_by_user":"gcupc"},"tags":["ai","pdf"]},{"short_id":"fc5hxh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fc5hxh","created_at":"2021-01-23T09:51:47.000-06:00","title":"AXPbox 1.0.0 released - open source Alpha emulator","url":"https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/releases/tag/v1.0.0","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fc5hxh/axpbox_1_0_0_released_open_source_alpha","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":8243,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["osdev","release","show"]},{"short_id":"rzvup1","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rzvup1","created_at":"2021-01-22T21:40:18.000-06:00","title":"fe - A tiny, embeddable language implemented in ANSI C in less than 800 sloc","url":"https://github.com/rxi/fe","score":29,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rzvup1/fe_tiny_embeddable_language_implemented","submitter_user":{"username":"technetium","created_at":"2020-02-06T19:52:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"help what's an about","is_moderator":false,"karma":1099,"avatar_url":"/avatars/technetium-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum"},"tags":["c","lisp"]},{"short_id":"1frogx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1frogx","created_at":"2021-01-23T17:17:52.000-06:00","title":"pfSense is Closed Source (2017)","url":"https://github.com/rapi3/pfsense-is-closed-source","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1frogx/pfsense_is_closed_source_2017","submitter_user":{"username":"jornane","created_at":"2019-06-04T06:18:20.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":619,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jornane-100.png","invited_by_user":"fkooman"},"tags":["historical","law","rant"]},{"short_id":"amxt2t","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/amxt2t","created_at":"2021-01-23T10:34:34.000-06:00","title":"S3P - Massively Parallel S3 Copying","url":"https://www.genui.com/open-source/s3p-massively-parallel-s3-copying","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/amxt2t/s3p_massively_parallel_s3_copying","submitter_user":{"username":"eatonphil","created_at":"2019-09-01T20:23:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software Development Manager at Oracle;
