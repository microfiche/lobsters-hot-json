However, I’m not sure what hardware (or software, if that’s a separate thing like pfSense) to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the apartment we’re using Google Wifi hardware so we don’t need to leave servers in a network closet, but it’s fairly limited and is very tied to Google. One of the most “fun” issues I’ve had is that it caches all DNS requests and will even re-try those requests (I assume with Google’s DNS servers) even if you tell DHCP to report another DNS server (such as if you’re trying to run PiHole internally). Additionally, all DNS requests on pihole come from the gateway rather than the clients, which messes with some of pihole’s features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a few people have evangelized Ubiquiti hardware, but I’ve been hearing about friends having issues with wifi, and a recent \u003ca href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003efairly large breach\u003c/a\u003e which make me question going all-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what do you use for your home?

If I don't extend an invite, it doesn't mean no-one else will. Be polite, be open, and be patient.\r\n\r\nFirst step, please reach out to the community in [chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and let us know why you want to be a part of the community. \r\n\r\nI will typically request some form of proof that your username is associated with a public profile on a social network (and yes, I count GitHub as a social network). If you do not wish to share such information in the general chat, I will not consider extending an invite. \r\n\r\nI will probably not extend an invite if your online behavior exhibits sexism, misogyny, racism or homophobia. \r\n\r\nI will politely ignore unsolicitated requests for invites via Twitter DM or email.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8813,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe","twitter_username":"gerikson"},"tags":["go"]},{"short_id":"n4ln3b","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/n4ln3b","created_at":"2021-03-30T22:09:11.000-05:00","title":"AABB from OBB with component-wise abs","url":"https://zeux.io/2010/10/17/aabb-from-obb-with-component-wise-abs/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/n4ln3b/aabb_from_obb_with_component_wise_abs","submitter_user":{"username":"friendlysock","created_at":"2014-02-20T00:43:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"*Literally* full of ants.\r\n\r\nFriendly engineer and human being.\r\n\r\nStrong opinions held weakly, sometimes weekly.\r\n\r\n\u003e Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified and alchemised into money. \r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":33582,"avatar_url":"/avatars/friendlysock-100.png","invited_by_user":"MasonJar"},"tags":["math"]},{"short_id":"amkzup","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/amkzup","created_at":"2021-03-29T12:26:46.000-05:00","title":"The end of TenFourFox and what I've learned from it","url":"http://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-end-of-tenfourfox-and-what-ive.html","score":31,"flags":0,"comment_count":11,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/amkzup/end_tenfourfox_what_i_ve_learned_from_it","submitter_user":{"username":"ehamberg","created_at":"2014-08-18T02:47:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://keybase.io/eh","is_moderator":false,"karma":2644,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ehamberg-100.png","invited_by_user":"oleavr"},"tags":["browsers","mac"]},{"short_id":"jpj5ru","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jpj5ru","created_at":"2021-03-29T17:35:01.000-05:00","title":"Hello, HPy","url":"https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2021/03/hello-hpy/","score":32,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jpj5ru/hello_hpy","submitter_user":{"username":"kngl","created_at":"2017-06-15T14:58:55.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Odoo Developer\r\n\r\n🦘/🦞","is_moderator":false,"karma":699,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kngl-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum","github_username":"KangOl"},"tags":["c","python"]},{"short_id":"c05dgd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c05dgd","created_at":"2021-03-29T09:28:21.000-05:00","title":"git's commit workflow is backwards, and encourages bad habits","url":"https://rory.bio/posts/git-plan/","score":40,"flags":0,"comment_count":38,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c05dgd/git_s_commit_workflow_is_backwards","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":74626,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["practices","vcs"]}]
