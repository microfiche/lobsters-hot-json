But I want to know from someone who has done it before without taking downtime and affecting production traffic.\r\n\r\nA few articles suggested an unconventional 3-step approach:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new dummy column and an index on the new column. Deploy the code, making sure you write to both columns.\r\n2. Backfill the data to the new column.\r\n3. Drop the old column and rename the dummy column to the old column.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know if someone has used it or if you have tackled the problem at the root by not allowing the data to grow that large, possibly by partitioning, sharding or archiving based on the use case.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zh3dek/indexing_column_large_postgres_table","submitter_user":{"username":"dineshgowda","created_at":"2022-07-06T22:16:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":70,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dineshgowda-100.png","invited_by_user":"av","github_username":"dineshgowda24"},"tags":["databases","programming"]}]
