In the distant past there were also electronic organizers/databanks but these were very slow, had very little memory, zero way of import/export data (or some rudimentary, obscure one) and I actually remember typing on one which slowed down when I was trying to write few paragraphs into a single note. However, such thing with 2023 technology would rock - that's not a market advice, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my quest is still not yet solved, but I carried myself away a bit here - **I would like to hear about your experiences**, how do you approach the note taking / brain dumping or is that even a problem for you? I don't expect solving my specific case, but maybe I could learn a thing or two from people in comments.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xaj9bz/what_s_your_braindump_second_brain","submitter_user":{"username":"skrzyp","created_at":"2016-05-21T16:41:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"````\r\n````","is_moderator":false,"karma":1567,"avatar_url":"/avatars/skrzyp-100.png","invited_by_user":"mulander"},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"do04rg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/do04rg","created_at":"2023-08-25T14:01:52.000-05:00","title":"Python Security Response Team handling of CVE-2023-40217","url":"https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-8","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/do04rg/python_security_response_team_handling","submitter_user":{"username":"sethmlarson","created_at":"2021-10-19T13:53:10.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I write about Python, API design, and Internet technologies.
