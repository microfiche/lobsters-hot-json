My blog is called [Not a Monad Tutorial](http://notamonadtutorial.com/). I am the tech lead of a small company I own called [LambdaClass](https://github.com/lambdaclass/).\r\n\r\nThe language I like the most for that task is Erlang since it has a lot of built-in tools and features that other languages don't have. In companion with Erlang, I usually use databases such as Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL and message queues such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. I work a lot with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux and devops tools like Ansible, Chef, Terraform, Grafana and Prometheus. The last year I've started doing some work in the Deep Learning space with Python, Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nAt last I love playing with OCaml, Racket/Lisp, Rust and Elm.
