Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":140,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["programming","video"]},{"short_id":"vyaimx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vyaimx","created_at":"2023-01-20T16:04:51.000-06:00","title":"Source code for Adobe PostScript 1.0 released","url":"https://computerhistory.org/blog/postscript-a-digital-printing-press/?_hsmi=242355795\u0026_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8frF7VzXO-ffqoGUATsxoRI24JMgSJv-Q8Ic0bUou5TYLoN5ZWdOAEbp8o_NaOUIGgKt7D5DbgGFp00TVUOAVaTc_OU0k7RRp1jf9CZzfOOlvff0c","score":1,"flags":1,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vyaimx/source_code_for_adobe_postscript_1_0","submitter_user":{"username":"lorddimwit","created_at":"2016-08-15T09:39:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":12761,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lorddimwit-100.png","invited_by_user":"cks","github_username":"deadpixi"},"tags":["historical","plt"]}]
