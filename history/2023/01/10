Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["design","unix"]},{"short_id":"y9uzyx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx","created_at":"2023-01-09T05:13:39.000-06:00","title":"Three Lessons from Threema: Analysis of a Secure Messenger","url":"https://breakingthe3ma.app/","score":19,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx/three_lessons_from_threema_analysis","submitter_user":{"username":"fkooman","created_at":"2015-09-14T06:39:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://fosstodon.org/@fkooman","is_moderator":false,"karma":1685,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fkooman-100.png","invited_by_user":"untitaker"},"tags":["cryptography","security"]},{"short_id":"zbvwrp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zbvwrp","created_at":"2023-01-09T12:20:20.000-06:00","title":"Vulkan Video decoding","url":"https://lynne.ee/vulkan-video-decoding.html","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zbvwrp/vulkan_video_decoding","submitter_user":{"username":"tgfrerer","created_at":"2020-07-29T05:36:54.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"graphics, mostly.","is_moderator":false,"karma":87,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tgfrerer-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B","github_username":"tgfrerer","twitter_username":"tgfrerer"},"tags":["graphics"]},{"short_id":"yuxzus","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yuxzus","created_at":"2023-01-09T15:29:28.000-06:00","title":"Introducing Content Defined Chunking (CDC)","url":"https://restic.net/blog/2015-09-12/restic-foundation1-cdc/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yuxzus/introducing_content_defined_chunking","submitter_user":{"username":"hyperpape","created_at":"2016-06-30T19:22:53.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Into goofy hacks, optimization, compilers, and also everything else under the sun.
