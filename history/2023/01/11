As a user I would prefer to use a short and memorable password (regardless of what that means), which means having fewer entropy bits.\r\n\r\nAnother complication is password derivation functions (like Argon, `scrypt`, `bcrypt`, the newer `bscrypt`, or in the worst case some variant of PBKDF) which helps us gain some entropy bits through time spent.\r\n\r\nSo my question is:  given adequate defaults for a password derivation function, how many bits of entropy do I require for my password to be practically unbreakable in my lifetime (~100 years)?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIs 64 bits enough?  Is 72 bits enough?  Should I go up to 128 bits?","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wlq6nm/where_do_we_draw_line_on_password_strength","submitter_user":{"username":"ciprian_craciun","created_at":"2022-02-14T13:47:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"IT enthusiast, from programming to operating systems, from networking to cryptography, from cloud to hardware, from Erlang to Java.","is_moderator":false,"karma":578,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ciprian_craciun-100.png","invited_by_user":"syn-ack"},"tags":["ask","security"]},{"short_id":"i1jsre","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/i1jsre","created_at":"2023-01-11T05:41:21.000-06:00","title":"Another NaN-based tagging strategy for dynamic programming languages","url":"https://outerproduct.net/trivial/2023-01-11_nan.html","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/i1jsre/another_nan_based_tagging_strategy_for","submitter_user":{"username":"Moonchild","created_at":"2018-04-01T12:28:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2392,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Moonchild-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["compilers","performance","plt"]},{"short_id":"x1bdsk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x1bdsk","created_at":"2023-01-11T05:12:11.000-06:00","title":"Raspberry Pi revives a Smith Corona word processor","url":"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-revives-a-smith-corona-word-processor/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/x1bdsk/raspberry_pi_revives_smith_corona_word","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19092,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["hardware","historical"]},{"short_id":"hkyhzc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hkyhzc","created_at":"2023-01-10T01:32:52.000-06:00","title":"Surprising Consequences of macOS’s Environment Variable Sanitization","url":"https://hynek.me/articles/macos-dyld-env/","score":19,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hkyhzc/surprising_consequences_macos_s","submitter_user":{"username":"hynek","created_at":"2019-05-21T05:22:22.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Code Bohemian ❤️ Python 🐍, Go 🐹, \u0026 small-scale DevOps 🔧 • blogger 📝 • speaker 📢 • PSF fellow 🏆• urban beach bum 🏄🏻 • 😇 of 💩✈️ • seeking apatheia 🧘 • 🗣🇨🇿🇩🇪🇺🇸","is_moderator":false,"karma":346,"avatar_url":"/avatars/hynek-100.png","invited_by_user":"EWDurbin","github_username":"hynek","twitter_username":"hynek","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"hynek","sig_hash":"739ea423c59de34a30188ccb70293ccf1feb74588d4408cf12fc30062e4e889b0f"}]},"tags":["mac","security"]},{"short_id":"pizpew","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pizpew","created_at":"2023-01-11T00:21:00.000-06:00","title":"How Query Engines Work","url":"https://howqueryengineswork.com","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pizpew/how_query_engines_work","submitter_user":{"username":"seasidedrum","created_at":"2021-03-22T08:40:49.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Interested in low-level systems, performance optimization, compilers and maths.","is_moderator":false,"karma":372,"avatar_url":"/avatars/seasidedrum-100.png","invited_by_user":"arun"},"tags":["databases"]}]
