Interpreters\u003c/strong\u003e | Sebastian Graf, Simon Peyton Jones, Sven Keidel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstract\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe explore denotational interpreters: denotational semantics that produce coinductive traces of a corresponding small-step operational semantics. By parameterising our denotational interpreter over the semantic domain and then varying it, we recover dynamic semantics with different evaluation strategies as well as summary-based static analyses such as type analysis, all from the same generic interpreter. Among our contributions is the first provably adequate denotational semantics for call-by-need. The generated traces lend themselves well to describe operational properties such as evaluation cardinality, and hence to static analyses abstracting these operational properties. Since static analysis and dynamic semantics share the same generic interpreter definition, soundness proofs via abstract interpretation decompose into showing small abstraction laws about the abstract domain, thus obviating complicated ad-hoc preservation-style proof frameworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","description_plain":"**Abstracting Denotational Interpreters** | Sebastian Graf, Simon Peyton Jones, Sven Keidel\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\u003e We explore denotational interpreters: denotational semantics that produce coinductive traces of a corresponding small-step operational semantics. By parameterising our denotational interpreter over the semantic domain and then varying it, we recover dynamic semantics with different evaluation strategies as well as summary-based static analyses such as type analysis, all from the same generic interpreter.
