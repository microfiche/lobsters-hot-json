For the last few years I have been an independent contractor working with smaller startups in information security. I have just finished a longer engagement into hardware reversing and am taking something of a breather doing more playful things. On the open-source side of the world, I am the architect and lead engineer of the Arcan project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are paper trails that say I am a software engineer, yet others that say I am a computer scientist. For me, I tend to stick with the term ‘reverser’; it means little to most but much to a few and the few tend to interest me more than the many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy background in computing is life-long. I am a child of the personal computing era. My conversations with the Commodore 64 happened much too early, starting with the Usborne Publishing ‘Computer Battlegames’ book and continued into devouring anything the local library could provide thereafter, picking up English in the process. This took place in a small village close to the 56th parallel north where computers were mostly dismissed as witchcraft and being accused of performing witchcraft didn’t make life any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will try and fail to keep this short, condensing the last three decades into three pivotal moments. The first moment from my preteens-into-teens was emulation. With home consoles becoming more prevalent I got curious as to why games on one system wouldn’t run on another, especially not on my own beloved computer: Isn’t it all just code? I started asking around in the circle of much older explorers and penpals and got a cursory explanation that it was difficult and unreasonable. That sounded like just my thing. Someone handed me a printout of phone numbers to ‘Bulletin Boards’ which led to heavier drugs like FidoNet and a small world suddenly became very large and down the rabbit hole I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second pivot was the PhD thing. I enrolled at university to try and get some structure to the chaos of being primarily autodidactic. It was a small university that had the reputation of being a place for ‘hackers’ through the ‘software engineering’ disguise. For a small pocket of time the student housing area was a sight to behold, and every scene from cracking to osdev to demos to gamedev was represented in abundance. There was an offer of a place to work in a lab, coding 3D engines and visualizations for demonstrators of autonomous coordination of naval vessels and submarines and things like that. I built something of a repertoire with the professor that was pulling the strings, which started the doctoral journey. My main interest was (and remains) debugging when things grow large, complex and distributed. Following the money meant that the best fit at the time was SCADA for critical infrastructure, and the consequences when energy systems would need to be restructured to deal with consumers also being producers and you can no longer hide behind the lie of control systems being ‘air-gapped’. In that context nobody would listen if you talked debugging, so I had to flip the switch to talk about security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third pivot was first an industrial collaboration that turned into employment at a tiger-team (the ‘Men in Black’) at Sony-Ericsson, now SONY Mobile. This happened just before the transition from feature-phones into smartphones. This group dealt with putting out fires, meaning critical bugs that others had given up on but meant the death of a product or possibly the company if it caused device returns. The margins were razor thin; if you could save a few cents on the BOM by not having a MMU and process isolation, you saved a few cents on the BOM. A close friend and I tried to distil some of these lessons into trainings and a university course on the subject, with the ‘NDA friendly’ version still around on the Internet somewhere under the idea of ‘Systemic Software Debugging’ which I hope to revisit someday in a more approachable format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your work/computing environment like?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery compartmentalised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house is less of a house and more of a daycare for forever young techies. I have one lab for coding with a big desktop and a lot of ‘one purpose devices’, novelty displays and input tech. Of note is a small cluster of ephemeral devices that boot from preset images and run some software that I need but deeply distrust (like web browsers). These reset and re-image (saving raw-disk diffs if something strange happens) and map into tabs, though the windowing scheme used is quite different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work offline with ‘bare minimal’ editor and man pages instead of IDEs and autocompletion as I tend to, paraphrasing James Mickens, break my tools with my tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lab doubles as a home theater. This is used for VR and general controlled environment ‘audio/video’ testing. The more playful things happen in the basement area around pinball machines and DIY arcade games. Pinballs are great fun for computer-vision like experiments. The latest addition is a more controlled space for lower level hardware work - with the usual scopes, some laser ‘cutters’, CNCs, 3D printers and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also rely on printing things on paper and scribble. I always carry at least one notebook or e-Ink notetaker. There is also something almost purifying when later shredding and incinerating the evidence. When travelling, commuting or just hiding in a pub or bar for a change of scenery I nowadays tend to use AR glasses hooked up to a steam deck or laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt some point it appears that you decided to rewrite the *NIX graphics stack from scratch, how did that happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly and regrettably. Knowing what I know today I probably would not have bothered.

Picking a single person from this community is hard, but [Arcan](https://arcan-fe.com) is the project that I wish I had the time, expertise, and patience to have written, so I had to choose @crazyloglad.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Introduce yourself, describe what you do for work and how long you’ve been at it.\r\n\r\nHello! For the last few years I have been an independent contractor working with smaller startups in information security. I have just finished a longer engagement into hardware reversing and am taking something of a breather doing more playful things. On the open-source side of the world, I am the architect and lead engineer of the Arcan project.\r\n\r\nThere are paper trails that say I am a software engineer, yet others that say I am a computer scientist. For me, I tend to stick with the term ‘reverser’; it means little to most but much to a few and the few tend to interest me more than the many.\r\n\r\nMy background in computing is life-long. I am a child of the personal computing era. My conversations with the Commodore 64 happened much too early, starting with the Usborne Publishing ‘Computer Battlegames’ book and continued into devouring anything the local library could provide thereafter, picking up English in the process. This took place in a small village close to the 56th parallel north where computers were mostly dismissed as witchcraft and being accused of performing witchcraft didn’t make life any easier.\r\n\r\nI will try and fail to keep this short, condensing the last three decades into three pivotal moments. The first moment from my preteens-into-teens was emulation. With home consoles becoming more prevalent I got curious as to why games on one system wouldn’t run on another, especially not on my own beloved computer: Isn’t it all just code? I started asking around in the circle of much older explorers and penpals and got a cursory explanation that it was difficult and unreasonable. That sounded like just my thing. Someone handed me a printout of phone numbers to ‘Bulletin Boards’ which led to heavier drugs like FidoNet and a small world suddenly became very large and down the rabbit hole I went.\r\n\r\nThe second pivot was the PhD thing. I enrolled at university to try and get some structure to the chaos of being primarily autodidactic. It was a small university that had the reputation of being a place for ‘hackers’ through the ‘software engineering’ disguise. For a small pocket of time the student housing area was a sight to behold, and every scene from cracking to osdev to demos to gamedev was represented in abundance. There was an offer of a place to work in a lab, coding 3D engines and visualizations for demonstrators of autonomous coordination of naval vessels and submarines and things like that. I built something of a repertoire with the professor that was pulling the strings, which started the doctoral journey. My main interest was (and remains) debugging when things grow large, complex and distributed. Following the money meant that the best fit at the time was SCADA for critical infrastructure, and the consequences when energy systems would need to be restructured to deal with consumers also being producers and you can no longer hide behind the lie of control systems being ‘air-gapped’. In that context nobody would listen if you talked debugging, so I had to flip the switch to talk about security.\r\n\r\nThe third pivot was first an industrial collaboration that turned into employment at a tiger-team (the ‘Men in Black’) at Sony-Ericsson, now SONY Mobile. This happened just before the transition from feature-phones into smartphones. This group dealt with putting out fires, meaning critical bugs that others had given up on but meant the death of a product or possibly the company if it caused device returns. The margins were razor thin; if you could save a few cents on the BOM by not having a MMU and process isolation, you saved a few cents on the BOM. A close friend and I tried to distil some of these lessons into trainings and a university course on the subject, with the ‘NDA friendly’ version still around on the Internet somewhere under the idea of ‘Systemic Software Debugging’ which I hope to revisit someday in a more approachable format.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What is your work/computing environment like?\r\n\r\nVery compartmentalised.\r\n\r\nMy house is less of a house and more of a daycare for forever young techies. I have one lab for coding with a big desktop and a lot of ‘one purpose devices’, novelty displays and input tech. Of note is a small cluster of ephemeral devices that boot from preset images and run some software that I need but deeply distrust (like web browsers). These reset and re-image (saving raw-disk diffs if something strange happens) and map into tabs, though the windowing scheme used is quite different.\r\n\r\nI work offline with ‘bare minimal’ editor and man pages instead of IDEs and autocompletion as I tend to, paraphrasing James Mickens, break my tools with my tools.\r\n\r\nAnother lab doubles as a home theater. This is used for VR and general controlled environment ‘audio/video’ testing. The more playful things happen in the basement area around pinball machines and DIY arcade games. Pinballs are great fun for computer-vision like experiments. The latest addition is a more controlled space for lower level hardware work - with the usual scopes, some laser ‘cutters’, CNCs, 3D printers and so on.\r\n\r\nI also rely on printing things on paper and scribble. I always carry at least one notebook or e-Ink notetaker. There is also something almost purifying when later shredding and incinerating the evidence. When travelling, commuting or just hiding in a pub or bar for a change of scenery I nowadays tend to use AR glasses hooked up to a steam deck or laptop.\r\n\r\n# At some point it appears that you decided to rewrite the *NIX graphics stack from scratch, how did that happen?\r\n\r\nReluctantly and regrettably. Knowing what I know today I probably would not have bothered. I approach ‘system graphics’ from an angle of signal processing and queueing theory (IPC systems) rather than what most think of as ‘graphics’. In that sense we are mixing and resampling signals much more than drawing pixels. Very little of the actual work is modern graphics, and I am artificially constrained by the capability ‘sweet-spot’ of the first generation Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nThis is done in order to get away from the influence of GPUs that only a few can build and comprehend, and to be able to work on simpler dedicated processors that many more can design and build. Many architectural decisions in Arcan are explicitly to begin the painful decoupling from proprietary GPUs. The modern GPU ecosystem is highly abusive and deliberately user unfriendly yet is in a place where it is actually running the show. I don’t like that.\r\n\r\nThere is also a personal story of trying to build the panopticon of debugging. With that I mean ‘observing and experimenting’ with the Rube Goldberg contraption of what we unknowingly build by smashing pieces of software together. Even though the individual pieces can sometimes be formally proven to work and then actually made to work, the solutions that we end up with often solves some problem in a very convoluted way, but we lack the faculties to see it. Part of the reason for that is a tooling problem.\r\n\r\nThis coincides with the other side of the same coin. What I am trying to achieve with the Arcan project, and the sole reason any of this is public, is that I want to string together some of the frayed threads of our history. With that I mean to resurrect some of what we lost from the personal computer era where you just ‘powered on and started to code’ as a means of exploring computing. This is not meant as a retrocomputing romance. The output should be more capable than what we already have, not less. There are other and far more interesting and intimate webs to uncover than the ones we have, Ted Nelson even said as much.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I keep aiming that any layer follows the model of having agency be defined and scriptable in Lua - which I find to be a more civilized take on BASIC. Lua is a fair vantage point for working towards the abstract if that is your thing, but also for digging further down the stack. The target audience is not so much the developers that are, as much as the ones that should come. For that aim to have any chance of success at all, controlling the tactile, the aural and the visual need to be much more approachable and many still start their journey programming games.\r\n\r\n# You mentioned that you sometime regret going down the path of building a new display system, if you could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would it be?\r\n\r\nBecause you asked for one, I will provide two – mainly because the most important one is really short: Disseminate earlier. The distance from what has been done and where my mental model currently sits compared to what is written down or published is several years. I was afraid of stepping on toes even though I should be crushing feet. There are good reasons as to why I couldn’t, but that doesn’t invalidate the fact that I was overly careful and have been paying the price ever since.\r\n\r\nThe real ‘one’ would be to stick to the first plan for the integration story. For a long time I simply used Xorg as the user space portion of the display driver and had all my bits and pieces running as the one and only full screen surface, just disable its native socket after setup and done. There was simply not much to gain from trying to use the lower level interfaces as they were being split out and refactored away from Xorg. I have easily wasted years trying to untangle issues caused by subtle changes to that neverending refactoring story and the building blocks are still woefully incomplete.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I maintained a private, less than friendly version of Android that swapped out parts of their stack for mine using all the tricks in the offensive software engineering playbook. This was abandoned a long time ago and I shouldn’t have done so. Part of the reason I did was the fallout from witnessing FirefoxOS from a front row seat. The architecture I was trying to push would have had a much better chance (still dangerously close to zero). In the end that would have been a much more fruitful path than the FreeDesktop one, which could have been retrofitted much later. The strategic position of having a seemless transition away from the Android we know today that isn’t hinged on whole-system virtualization would have been very valuable.\r\n\r\n# You said that part of your goal is tying together the frayed threads of history.
