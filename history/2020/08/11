a\nperformance improvement.\nPreviously we memoized the number of \u003ccode\u003eupvotes\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003edownvotes\u003c/code\u003e on both the \u003ccode\u003estories\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecomments\u003c/code\u003e tables.\nMany queries sorted by score, which they had to calculate per-row with \u003ccode\u003eupvotes - downvotes\u003c/code\u003e.\nNo queries directly used \u003ccode\u003eupvotes\u003c/code\u003e, so I replaced it by memoizing \u003ccode\u003escore\u003c/code\u003e instead.\nThe migration for this locked the tables, so we took downtime - that’s now completed. \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/u/355E3B\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003e@355E3B\u003c/a\u003e and I \u003cdel\u003eare squishing\u003c/del\u003e have squished some small followup bugs; please file github issues or let us know in \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/chat\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003echat\u003c/a\u003e if you see anything odd.\nAnd then as long as finishing that migration meant running it five times on my machine to iron out bugs, I picked up some other features we’ve been figuring out for a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve redesigned the \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/tags\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003etags page\u003c/a\u003e with categories to help make sense of it.\nThis was prompted by \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/u/355E3B\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003e@355E3B\u003c/a\u003e’s \u003ca href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/5d3ca35ef0242a66\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eanalysis of our tags\u003c/a\u003e and the page’s\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/735\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003elongstanding design issues\u003c/a\u003e.\nI’m leaving the issue open because there’s still room for improvement.\nPerhaps use our \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/0a5b1b1023c0bf0702c25af21bbcb46294eebf72\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003enewly added\u003c/a\u003e svg \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/stats\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003egraphing\u003c/a\u003e library to add sparklines showing usage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know categories are a really tempting bikeshed, so let me emphasize that categories and tags are not intended to be an epistemologically complete ontology of the entire field of computing.\nThey make the page look nice.\nMaybe, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/f718da18205ae9fcabe45903677572651274b6fe\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003elike domains\u003c/a\u003e, they’ll slowly grow functionality, but let’s not overthink them too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve revamped the comment flagging UI to further emphasize that they’re for alerting mods when a user doesn’t want to engage and curb their abuse for punishing disagreement.\nVisually, flagging comments now looks like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/452c75908d492cbd2cc4e9fd3e557f7b3488f9e6\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eflagging stories\u003c/a\u003e with a text link rather than an down-pointing arrow, and flagging a comment collapses the tree.\nNothing on the site refers to “downvoting” any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve also expanded the \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/about\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eabout page\u003c/a\u003e with material on \u003ca

deactivated the ‘Incorrect’ flag reason that was mostly used to disagree with people rather than indicate serious problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this is a roughly accurate collection of community norms and expectations.\nAs usual for changes, these are not the final version we’ll ever have.\nIf you see ways to improve these things, I appreciate help identifying what’s wrong, proposing solutions, and implementing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, last month I asked \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/u/kyle\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ekyle\u003c/a\u003e if he was still interested in being a moderator, as it had been a long time since he was active.\nHe replied that he’s not not active online much anymore and not interested in continuing as a mod.\nA few days later he deactivated a bunch of online accounts, including this one.\nHe leaves with our thanks for volunteering and best wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wdjrcd/tags_flags","submitter_user":{"username":"pushcx","created_at":"2012-08-14T20:25:08.000-05:00","is_admin":true,"about":"Hi,
