It’s very hands-on and readers will write application code and integrate it with tooling from various layers of a modern service stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, readers will encapsulate two applications using Docker, run a private container registry to host images, deploy to Kubernetes, configure health checks, scale the instance count, and allow the apps to communicate with each other. Readers will send logs to Elasticsearch, build a dashboard with Kibana, send metrics to StatsD/Graphite, build another dashboard with Graphite, transmit request spans and visualize request hierarchies with Zipkin. They’ll even configure a CI pipeline, run unit tests, enforce code coverage, and deploy to a production server. And that isn’t even half of it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote this book as a Node.js developer who loves writing code that runs on the server but who doesn’t have much interest in frontend development.
