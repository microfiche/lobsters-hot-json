During most of the VLSI era, processors that passed manufacturing tests and were operated within specifications have insulated us from this fiction. As fabrication pushes towards smaller feature sizes and more elaborate computational structures, and as increasingly specialized instruction-silicon pairings are introduced to improve performance, we have observed ephemeral computational errors that were not detected during manufacturing tests. These defects cannot always be mitigated by techniques such as microcode updates, and may be correlated to specific components within the processor, allowing small code changes to effect large shifts in reliability. Worse, these failures are often ‚Äúsilent‚Äù ‚Äì the only symptom is an erroneous computation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uaguoh/cores_don_t_count","submitter_user":{"username":"GeoffWozniak","created_at":"2014-03-02T15:01:50.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software developer, mostly interested in compilation, programming languages, and the history of software practices, particularly debugging techniques.
