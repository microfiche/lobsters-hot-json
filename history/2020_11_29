Therefore the main focus of my professional work currently is auditing cryptography and also developing Verifpal, an automated cryptographic protocol modeling, analysis and verification framework and a project that I am very passionate about.\r\n\r\nSince its founding in 2018, Symbolic Software has completed and delivered over 200 software and cryptographic audits for clients all around the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, I defended my Ph.D. thesis, Formal Verification for Real-World Cryptographic Protocols and Implementations, at Inria Paris, after 3¬Ω years of research with team PROSECCO, where I had the inimitable privilege of studying under Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Bruno Blanchet.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 and 2019, I also designed and taught the computer security course at New York University's Paris campus, where I served as an adjunct professor.
