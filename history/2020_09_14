To clarify, I previously had few PPC/G4 machines, and some kind of Air for a couple of days at work to do some video editing work for bunch of screencasts. Oh, and we used the first Intel iMacs at middle school with some Apple-specific OpenOffice fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I‚Äôm briefly familiar with ‚Äúhow Macs work‚Äù in general, but this particular machine is my very first, brand new, current-gen and out of the box personal Apple computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the question is: What should I do now? Which software you can suggest me to install? What settings/tunables I might change/add/update? What changed in Mac OS X during the recent years, and - probably the most important fact - which kind of ‚Äúcomputing pleasures‚Äù I can ‚Äúexplore‚Äù or ‚Äúexperience‚Äù on modern Macintoshes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now I‚Äôve installed \u003ca href=\"http://brew.sh\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eHomebrew\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://iterm2.com\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eiTerm2\u003c/a\u003e so you might be pretty sure that I‚Äôm going into that UNIX side of Apple, but I‚Äôm still eager to discover wonders of that ‚Äúcreative‚Äù or even ‚Äúregular day to day usage‚Äù parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might sound redundant to someone as I tried to ignite that discussion on Lobsters IRC last evening, but decided it would be better to move that into a story for wider audience where many people might share their ideas and other benefit from that using my own example as a source of nice tips, suggestions and
