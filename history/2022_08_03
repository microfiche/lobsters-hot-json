It must be portable, concurrent, and have short pause times. Simpler implementation is more important than good performance. Reference-counting and/or tracing garbage collection are both under consideration (I’m open to other suggestions too). The programmer should not have to think about memory management much, if at all (so, if reference-counting is used, the implementation should also detect reference cycles).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I look at introductory literature, I see simple schemes with long pause times. When I look at popular programming language implementations, I see schemes that are performant at the cost of a complex implementation. But what I want is a simpler implementation, and I am willing to accept poor performance (except for my concern about pause times). By simpler to implement I mean fewer lines of code; if a library for garbage collection, the LOC in that library counts too. This is all all relative; it is understood that the simplest implementation with short pause times may still be pretty complex, and also in addition I will accept a little implementation complexity in exchange for a lot of performance. The criteria are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eportable, concurrent, short pause times \u0026gt; simple implementation \u0026gt; low memory usage \u0026gt; fast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on the fence about compaction. I do want the user to be able to run programs for a long time without running out of memory. But compaction makes interop more complex. Various contemporary language implementations, such as Golang (Go) and Python have non-compacting GC and I don’t hear complaints about people’s programs crashing due to memory fragmentation. Is fragmentation only a theoretical issue that doesn’t come up in practice – or, do those implementations  do something complicated to avoid fragmentation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be a high-level programming language with a runtime. The runtime will know where pointers are and could do things like box values and store GC metadata there, have write barriers and/or read barriers, reference count, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not a vanilla mark-sweep collector?

It must be portable, concurrent, and have short pause times. Simpler implementation is more important than good performance. Reference-counting and/or tracing garbage collection are both under consideration (I'm open to other suggestions too). The programmer should not have to think about memory management much, if at all (so, if reference-counting is used, the implementation should also detect reference cycles).\r\n\r\nWhen I look at introductory literature, I see simple schemes with long pause times. When I look at popular programming language implementations, I see schemes that are performant at the cost of a complex implementation. But what I want is a simpler implementation, and I am willing to accept poor performance (except for my concern about pause times). By simpler to implement I mean fewer lines of code; if a library for garbage collection, the LOC in that library counts too. This is all all relative; it is understood that the simplest implementation with short pause times may still be pretty complex, and also in addition I will accept a little implementation complexity in exchange for a lot of performance. The criteria are:\r\n\r\n  portable, concurrent, short pause times \u003e simple implementation \u003e low memory usage \u003e fast\r\n\r\nI'm on the fence about compaction. I do want the user to be able to run programs for a long time without running out of memory. But compaction makes interop more complex. Various contemporary language implementations, such as Golang (Go) and Python have non-compacting GC and I don't hear complaints about people's programs crashing due to memory fragmentation. Is fragmentation only a theoretical issue that doesn't come up in practice -- or, do those implementations  do something complicated to avoid fragmentation?\r\n\r\nThis will be a high-level programming language with a runtime. The runtime will know where pointers are and could do things like box values and store GC metadata there, have write barriers and/or read barriers, reference count, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy not a vanilla mark-sweep collector?
