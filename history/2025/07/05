[PRs](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akernal053) who added the hat doffing feature, fixed up the forms for editing hats and stories, and added the 'last read' marker to /comments\r\n * @byroot [PRs](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abyroot) who helped diagnose performance and memory problems, and brought us up to Rails 7.2\r\n * @thomas0 [thomasdziedzic](https://github.com/thomasdziedzic) [PRs](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Athomasdziedzic) who fixed bugs in dev setup and is currently rewriting
