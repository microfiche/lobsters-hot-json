They also facilitate key rollover by acting as a distribution point for your shared secrets (which are wrapped with per-device KEKs).\r\n\r\nIf your devices are behind reasonable NAT, they will move towards a peer-to-peer connection, leaving the cathedral behind.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that The Reliquary is directly aimed at the hacker crowd as one should be familiar with certain topics to be able to feel comfortable with it (you need to handle your own key management, network setup, etc).\r\n\r\nA starting guide can be found at [2] for those who are interested.\r\n\r\nI built this to be useful to me and my hacker friends, I hope some of you might find it equally useful - I am happy to answer some questions but I dislike writing on public forums (digital agoraphobia?)\r\n\r\nYou can get in touch with me via joris@sanctorum.se\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\n[0] https://reliquary.se\r\n[1] https://sanctorum.se/sanctum/\r\n[2] https://reliquary.se/guide.html","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6w0ruh/end_end_encrypted_peer_peer_vpn_tunnels","submitter_user":"joris","user_is_author":true,"tags":["c","networking"]},{"short_id":"fv4p2u","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fv4p2u","created_at":"2025-01-08T04:08:01.000-06:00","title":"An Empirical Study of Rust-for-Linux: The Success, Dissatisfaction, and Compromise (2024)","url":"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc24-li-hongyu.pdf","score":4,"flags":1,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fv4p2u/empirical_study_rust_for_linux_success","submitter_user":"bitfield","user_is_author":false,"tags":["linux","pdf","rust"]},{"short_id":"22nnsp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/22nnsp","created_at":"2025-01-07T21:35:04.000-06:00","title":"Hyperview · Native mobile apps, as easy as creating a web site","url":"https://hyperview.org/","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/22nnsp/hyperview_native_mobile_apps_as_easy_as","submitter_user":"briankung","user_is_author":false,"tags":["mobile"]},{"short_id":"zigphj","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zigphj","created_at":"2025-01-06T12:24:34.000-06:00","title":"The future of htmx","url":"https://htmx.org/essays/future/","score":136,"flags":0,"comment_count":44,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zigphj/future_htmx","submitter_user":"jparise","user_is_author":false,"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"s0zjay","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s0zjay","created_at":"2025-01-06T18:35:09.000-06:00","title":"Zig's Comptime is Bonkers Good","url":"https://www.scottredig.com/blog/bonkers_comptime/","score":57,"flags":0,"comment_count":32,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s0zjay/zig_s_comptime_is_bonkers_good","submitter_user":"mlugg","user_is_author":false,"tags":["zig"]},{"short_id":"6jebmo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6jebmo","created_at":"2025-01-08T03:39:53.000-06:00","title":"Installing NixOS with the latest kernel","url":"https://silky.github.io/posts/nixos-latest-kernel.html","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6jebmo/installing_nixos_with_latest_kernel","submitter_user":"noon","user_is_author":true,"tags":["nix"]},{"short_id":"bed56d","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bed56d","created_at":"2025-01-07T02:13:26.000-06:00","title":"Mecha Comet -
