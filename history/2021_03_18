Algebraic graphs let us avoid partial functions typically caused by ‚Äòmalformed graphs‚Äô that contain an edge referring to anon-existent vertex. This helps to liberate APIs of existing graph libraries from partial functions.The algebra of graphs can represent directed, undirected, reflexive and transitive graphs, as well as hypergraphs, by appropriately choosing the set of underlying axioms.
