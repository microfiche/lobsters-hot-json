I was wondering if there is a niche for Erlang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince many years I am working mostly with Go. I enjoy the simple language, great tooling is and how it all enables to build. Another big plus for me is that the language does not evolve much.\nCurrently, I am a contractor, working preferably remotely for EU companies or locally in Berlin. Go allows me to always find work, proficiency in Python makes it only easier. Unfortunately, the project is almost always some form of web and microservices. I think I am searching for something a bit more challenging and mature. I would love to invest into a technology that will not disappear or change rapidly in the coming years. At the same time, something that will allow me to work on more complicated and fulfilling projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have read \u003ca href=\"https://ferd.ca/ten-years-of-erlang.html\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://ferd.ca/ten-years-of-erlang.html\u003c/a\u003e which provides a great insight into the Erlang project and community.

We detail adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks that exploit partitioning oracles to efficiently recover passwords and de-anonymize anonymous communications. The attacks utilize efficient key multi-collision algorithms‚Äîa cryptanalytic goal that we define‚Äîagainst widely used authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) schemes, including AES-GCM, XSalsa20/Poly1305, and ChaCha20/Poly1305.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe build a practical partitioning oracle attack that quickly recovers passwords from Shadowsocks proxy servers.

If I don't extend an invite, it doesn't mean no-one else will. Be polite, be open, and be patient.\r\n\r\nFirst step, please reach out to the community in [chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and let us know why you want to be a part of the community. \r\n\r\nI will typically request some form of proof that your username is associated with a public profile on a social network (and yes, I count GitHub as a social network). If you do not wish to share such information in the general chat, I will not consider extending an invite. \r\n\r\nI will probably not extend an invite if your online behavior exhibits sexism, misogyny, racism or homophobia. \r\n\r\nI will politely ignore unsolicitated requests for invites via Twitter DM or email.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8226,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe","twitter_username":"gerikson"},"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"fnuar9","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fnuar9","created_at":"2021-01-30T17:07:32.000-06:00","title":"IBM paperweight teardown: Reverse-engineering 1970s memory chips","url":"http://www.righto.com/2021/01/ibm-paperweight-teardown-reverse.html","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fnuar9/ibm_paperweight_teardown_reverse","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":71823,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","historical","reversing"]},{"short_id":"zqik2d","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zqik2d","created_at":"2021-01-30T12:49:29.000-06:00","title":"Machine That Changed The World: Interview with Ted Nelson (1990)","url":"https://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_4D37F2D8E1054BA49999027BF9D18957","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zqik2d/machine_changed_world_interview_with_ted","submitter_user":{"username":"karlicoss","created_at":"2019-09-06T06:00:43.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I [build things](https://github.com/karlicoss).\r\n\r\n[https://beepb00p.xyz](Here's my blog).","is_moderator":false,"karma":545,"avatar_url":"/avatars/karlicoss-100.png","invited_by_user":"lelf","github_username":"karlicoss","twitter_username":"karlicoss"},"tags":["historical","transcript","video","web"]},{"short_id":"hfrrqm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hfrrqm","created_at":"2021-01-30T16:15:17.000-06:00","title":"sudo: Ineffective NO_ROOT_MAILER and Baron Samedit","url":"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2021/q1/88","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hfrrqm/sudo_ineffective_no_root_mailer_baron","submitter_user":{"username":"fro","created_at":"2016-04-13T15:27:31.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":673,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fro-100.png","invited_by_user":"xero"},"tags":["security"]},{"short_id":"ebt6xx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ebt6xx","created_at":"2021-01-29T12:25:50.000-06:00","title":"What are you doing this weekend?","url":"","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":40,"description":"\u003cp\u003eFeel free to tell what you plan on doing this weekend and even ask for help or feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease keep in mind it‚Äôs more than OK to do nothing at all too!\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ebt6xx/what_are_you_doing_this_weekend","submitter_user":{"username":"caius","created_at":"2014-05-13T06:58:30.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Compulsive Geek, Ale Connoisseur, Head of Engineering at [SafeguardingMonitor](https://safeguardingmonitor.co.uk), Occasionally Responsible Adult.","is_moderator":false,"karma":5677,"avatar_url":"/avatars/caius-100.png","invited_by_user":"lauris","github_username":"caius","twitter_username":"Caius"},"tags":["ask","programming"]},{"short_id":"u7eto9","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/u7eto9","created_at":"2021-01-30T02:52:15.000-06:00","title":"Anticipating Your Memory Needs","url":"https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/anticipating-your-memory-needs","score":4,"flags":1,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/u7eto9/anticipating_your_memory_needs","submitter_user":{"username":"venam","created_at":"2017-07-04T05:45:41.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://venam.nixers.net/","is_moderator":false,"karma":609,"avatar_url":"/avatars/venam-100.png","invited_by_user":"mort","github_username":"venam"},"tags":["linux"]}]
