I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, responsive, and modern websites. My focus is on delivering the best experience for users on every device. Making faster, lighter, and more secure sites using Wordpress or Static Page Generators is my specialty. When I am not coding, I like to write new articles on my blog.\r\n\r\nsilvestar.codes","is_moderator":false,"karma":169,"avatar_url":"/avatars/starbist-100.png","invited_by_user":"awal","github_username":"maliMirkec","twitter_username":"malimirkeccita"},"tags":["css"]},{"short_id":"lvzz20","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lvzz20","created_at":"2021-03-31T00:51:11.000-05:00","title":"Arm Announces Armv9 Architecture: SVE2, Security, and the Next Decade","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16584/arm-announces-armv9-architecture","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lvzz20/arm_announces_armv9_architecture_sve2","submitter_user":{"username":"satai","created_at":"2018-07-12T07:35:15.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":154,"avatar_url":"/avatars/satai-100.png","invited_by_user":"dkvasnicka"},"tags":["ai","hardware"]},{"short_id":"3uzh3c","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3uzh3c","created_at":"2021-03-31T11:29:29.000-05:00","title":"Troubleshoot Boot and Networking Issues with New EC2 Serial Console","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/troubleshoot-boot-and-networking-issues-with-new-ec2-serial-console/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3uzh3c/troubleshoot_boot_networking_issues","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software developer.
