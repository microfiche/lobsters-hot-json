GNU Emacs can currently execute Elisp code either interpreted or byte-interpreted after it has been compiled to byte-code. In this work we discuss the implementation of an optimizing compiler approach for Elisp targeting native code. The native compiler employs the byte-compiler’s internal representation as input and exploits libgccjit to achieve code generation using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) infrastructure. Generated executables are stored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the functionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several optimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs core and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able to bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files, including the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA). Native-compiled Elisp shows an increase of performance ranging from 2.3x up to 42x with respect to the equivalent byte-code, measured over a set of small benchmarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vaswb5/bringing_gnu_emacs_native_code","submitter_user":{"username":"kir0ul","created_at":"2021-02-06T13:51:10.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":34,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kir0ul-100.png","invited_by_user":"Lomanic","github_username":"kir0ul"},"tags":["emacs","pdf"]},{"short_id":"6gks97","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6gks97","created_at":"2021-05-02T16:05:44.000-05:00","title":"Haiku activity report - March and April 2021","url":"https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/pulkomandy/2021-05-02-haiku_activity_report_march_april_2021/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6gks97/haiku_activity_report_march_april_2021","submitter_user":{"username":"ethoh","created_at":"2019-08-14T20:04:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3825,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ethoh-100.png","invited_by_user":"dwaite"},"tags":["historical","osdev"]},{"short_id":"potii3","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/potii3","created_at":"2021-05-02T22:14:23.000-05:00","title":"Python and me, or when in Rome","url":"http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/05/02/py/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/potii3/python_me_when_rome","submitter_user":{"username":"tbonesteaks","created_at":"2019-09-24T11:30:46.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Feel free to email me: 8e99a790-ca26-4895-9ac4-9cdfa208d761@anonaddy.me","is_moderator":false,"karma":565,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tbonesteaks-100.png","invited_by_user":"wink"},"tags":["practices","python"]},{"short_id":"mgdsgm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mgdsgm","created_at":"2021-05-02T21:03:09.000-05:00","title":"Delivering on an architecture strategy","url":"https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2019/12/09/delivering-on-an-architecture-strategy/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mgdsgm/delivering_on_architecture_strategy","submitter_user":{"username":"enxio","created_at":"2018-10-10T14:50:23.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":211,"avatar_url":"/avatars/enxio-100.png","invited_by_user":"molloy"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"anl6g2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/anl6g2","created_at":"2021-05-01T17:52:31.000-05:00","title":"Change desktop background image for all desktops","url":"https://gabrieldougherty.com/posts/macos-change-desktop-background-image/","score":12,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/anl6g2/change_desktop_background_image_for_all","submitter_user":{"username":"LolPython","created_at":"2019-03-09T13:58:12.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://github.com/GabrielDougherty\r\n\r\nhttps://gabrieldougherty.com/","is_moderator":false,"karma":295,"avatar_url":"/avatars/LolPython-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson"},"tags":["mac"]},{"short_id":"afixtg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/afixtg","created_at":"2021-05-02T04:13:08.000-05:00","title":"How to downgrade Ruby on Mac","url":"https://mac.install.guide/faq/downgrade-ruby/index.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/afixtg/how_downgrade_ruby_on_mac","submitter_user":{"username":"daniel_kehoe","created_at":"2012-08-29T13:24:39.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"**Daniel Kehoe**\r\n\r\nCanggu\r\n\r\n*\"webworn since 1991\"*\r\n\r\n[RailsApps](http://railsapps.github.com/) (open source Rails example apps and tutorials)\r\n\r\n[@rails_apps](http://twitter.com/rails_apps) on Twitter","is_moderator":false,"karma":76,"avatar_url":"/avatars/daniel_kehoe-100.png","invited_by_user":"tomdale"},"tags":["ruby"]},{"short_id":"phyl4f","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/phyl4f","created_at":"2021-05-02T18:15:29.000-05:00","title":"The Book of Quackery","url":"https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery/raw/main/The%20Book%20of%20Quackery.pdf","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003e“Quackery is a lightweight, open-source programming language suitable for recreational and educational purposes.
