(Don't get me wrong; totally blind people can program, but I never got used to doing it that way myself.)\r\n\r\nOf course, there's more to me than visual impairment. When it comes to programming, I'm also particularly interested in the challenges of developing cross-platform applications that integrate smoothly with the host platform.
