Be polite, be open, and be patient.\r\n\r\nFirst step, please reach out to the community in [chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and let us know why you want to be a part of the community. \r\n\r\nI will typically request some form of proof that your username is associated with a public profile on a social network (and yes, I count GitHub as a social network). If you do not wish to share such information in the general chat, I will not consider extending an invite. \r\n\r\nI will probably not extend an invite if your online behavior exhibits sexism, misogyny, racism or homophobia. \r\n\r\nI will politely ignore unsolicitated requests for invites via Twitter DM or email.","is_moderator":false,"karma":9019,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe","twitter_username":"gerikson"},"tags":["meta"]},{"short_id":"axxbi5","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/axxbi5","created_at":"2021-04-16T09:31:40.000-05:00","title":"PHP in 2021","url":"https://stitcher.io/blog/php-in-2021","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/axxbi5/php_2021","submitter_user":{"username":"jwk","created_at":"2014-02-26T16:51:28.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":128,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jwk-100.png","invited_by_user":"dubberx"},"tags":["php"]},{"short_id":"bdiyds","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bdiyds","created_at":"2021-04-15T20:49:26.000-05:00","title":"Orbit Tessellation","url":"https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/dev-diaries/6509/","score":29,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bdiyds/orbit_tessellation","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":75566,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["graphics"]},{"short_id":"kjlhle","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjlhle","created_at":"2021-04-16T10:15:10.000-05:00","title":"LLDB support for fork(2) and vfork(2)","url":"https://www.moritz.systems/blog/lldb-support-for-fork-and-vfork/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kjlhle/lldb_support_for_fork_2_vfork_2","submitter_user":{"username":"fcambus","created_at":"2012-09-10T08:43:10.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"System and Network engineer.\r\n\r\nInterests: ANSI Art, DNS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Security, and Text Mode.\r\n\r\nSite: https://www.cambus.net","is_moderator":false,"karma":3225,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fcambus-100.png","invited_by_user":"gmcabrita","github_username":"fcambus","twitter_username":"fcambus"},"tags":["debugging","freebsd","netbsd"]},{"short_id":"inb4o7","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/inb4o7","created_at":"2021-04-16T16:02:55.000-05:00","title":"Notes on building debugging puzzles","url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/04/16/notes-on-debugging-puzzles/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/inb4o7/notes_on_building_debugging_puzzles","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":75566,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["debugging","games"]},{"short_id":"pgsirp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pgsirp","created_at":"2021-04-16T19:50:45.000-05:00","title":"lmgrep -
