Be polite, be open, and be patient.\r\n\r\nFirst step, please reach out to the community in [chat](https://lobste.rs/chat) and let us know why you want to be a part of the community. \r\n\r\nI will typically request some form of proof that your username is associated with a public profile on a social network (and yes, I count GitHub as a social network). If you do not wish to share such information in the general chat, I will not consider extending an invite. \r\n\r\nI will probably not extend an invite if your online behavior exhibits sexism, misogyny, racism or homophobia. \r\n\r\nI will politely ignore unsolicitated requests for invites via Twitter DM or email.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8901,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe","twitter_username":"gerikson"},"tags":["historical","unix"]},{"short_id":"f1vgfq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f1vgfq","created_at":"2021-04-08T09:34:18.000-05:00","title":"How do you test your client-side web applications?","url":"","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":6,"description":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo you have tests?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat kind of tests do you write/create?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat software do you use for the tests?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen do you write/create them?
