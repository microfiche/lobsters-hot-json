I was wondering if there is a niche for Erlang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince many years I am working mostly with Go. I enjoy the simple language, great tooling is and how it all enables to build. Another big plus for me is that the language does not evolve much.\nCurrently, I am a contractor, working preferably remotely for EU companies or locally in Berlin. Go allows me to always find work, proficiency in Python makes it only easier. Unfortunately, the project is almost always some form of web and microservices. I think I am searching for something a bit more challenging and mature. I would love to invest into a technology that will not disappear or change rapidly in the coming years. At the same time, something that will allow me to work on more complicated and fulfilling projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have read \u003ca href=\"https://ferd.ca/ten-years-of-erlang.html\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://ferd.ca/ten-years-of-erlang.html\u003c/a\u003e which provides a great insight into the Erlang project and community.
