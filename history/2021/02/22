I figure since I’m enjoying myself it wouldn’t hurt to start with a more basic approach and learn the fundamentals so I can better “speak / read the language”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a few resources like this book: \u003ca href=\"https://www.crypto-textbook.com/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://www.crypto-textbook.com/\u003c/a\u003e and the accompanying YouTube lectures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hesitation from diving in is mainly from not knowing what resources are out dated / still relevant, and what a decent place to start is. My learning style is pretty flexible (I’ll get the answers I need), but just didn’t want to accidentally put a bunch of time into something that is not so useful anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose my end goal is to develop a good understanding of the underlying concepts so that I can apply them more confidently in practical settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I don’t have a formal CS / Math background I taught myself a lot of it (also from books) so I’m fairly confident there; anything I’m rusty on I can refresh myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear from anyone that has done this or is in the field for pointers…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks very much\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/edpwke/resources_for_crypto_fundamentals","submitter_user":{"username":"shishy","created_at":"2019-01-24T19:35:35.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm very interested in open science and privacy preserving technologies.\r\n\r\nCurrently working at scite (https://scite.ai)","is_moderator":false,"karma":78,"avatar_url":"/avatars/shishy-100.png","invited_by_user":"awal"},"tags":["ask","crypto"]},{"short_id":"h8ejms","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/h8ejms","created_at":"2021-02-20T08:52:57.000-06:00","title":"Immutable Systems Infrastructure, or how to mashup Kubernetes and Nix","url":"https://tevps.net/blog/2021/2/20/immutable-systems-infrastructure-or-how-mashup-kub/","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":7,"description":"\u003cp\u003eMostly reading a lot of posts on here about Nix, plus a personal project that’s using Kubernetes made me think about all of this.
