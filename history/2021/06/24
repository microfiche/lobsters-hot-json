In addition, I have discovered that \u003ccode\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e characters do not count as “quotations” and will be indented by one space in the actual sent text. This breaks manually edited quotations and makes it look like the entire body of the email is one quote, even if there are inline responses. Unfortunately, this decline in quality seems like the new modus operandi at Mozilla (especially judging by the recent changes they’ve made to Firefox).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, I am in the market for a new email client. So far I have looked at Evolution, which seems like it can do 90% of what Thunderbird does, and also seems to have a much nicer philosophy wrt user customization. The only problems I encountered were that it hangs on startup unless the main thread is stopped in gdb and resumed (wtf?), and that it lacks a “simple HTML” mode for viewing HTML emails without colors and whatnot. I also looked at sup with offlineimap, but I’m not very impressed by the setup. The lack of integration between the fetcher and the viewer makes for poor UX because of the difficulty of configuration and lack of flexibility. sup also crashes on startup (ugh).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat email client do you use?
