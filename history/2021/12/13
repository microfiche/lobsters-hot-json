Our goal is to bring the benefits of func- tional data structures to the discipline of systems programming via generic yet efficient immutable vectors supporting transient batch updates. We describe a C++ implementation that can be integrated in the runtime of higher level languages with a C core (Lisps like Guile or Racket, but also Python or Ruby), thus widening the access to these persistent data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nndizu/persistence_for_masses_rrb_vectors","submitter_user":{"username":"snej","created_at":"2020-01-26T19:05:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mobile Architect at Couchbase.
