introduce Perceus, an algorithm for precise reference counting with reuse and specialization. Starting from a functional core language with explicit control-flow, Perceus emits precise reference counting instructions such that (cycle-free) programs are garbage free, where only live references are retained. This enables further optimizations, like reuse analysis that allows for guaranteed in-place updates at runtime. This in turn enables a novel programming paradigm that we call functional but in-place (FBIP). Much like tail-call optimization enables writing loops with regular function calls, reuse analysis enables writing in-place mutating algorithms in a purely functional way. We give a novel formalization of reference counting in a linear resource calculus, and prove that Perceus is sound and garbage free. We show evidence that Perceus, as implemented in Koka, has good performance and is competitive with other state-of-the-art memory collectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qmtiul/perceus_garbage_free_reference_counting","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2277,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["pdf","programming"]},{"short_id":"hk1f2u","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hk1f2u","created_at":"2021-09-20T22:18:38.000-05:00","title":"How I patched Python to include this great Ruby feature","url":"https://opensource.com/article/21/9/python-else-less","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hk1f2u/how_i_patched_python_include_this_great","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":83553,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["python"]},{"short_id":"mnmorz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mnmorz","created_at":"2021-09-20T06:01:16.000-05:00","title":"What are you doing this week?","url":"","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing this week?
