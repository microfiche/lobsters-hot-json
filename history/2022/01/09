Recently, many people have come to realize that failure detection ought to be provided as some form of generic service, similar to IP address lookup or time synchronization. However, this has not been successful so far. One of the reasons is the difficulty to satisfy several application requirements simultaneously when using classical failure detectors. We present a novel abstraction, called accrual failure detectors, that emphasizes flexibility and expressiveness and can serve as a basic building block to implementing failure detectors in distributed systems. Instead of providing information of a boolean nature (trust vs. suspect), accrual failure detectors output a suspicion level on a continuous scale. The principal merit of this approach is that it favors a nearly complete decoupling between application requirements and the monitoring of the environment. In this paper, we describe an implementation of such an accrual failure detector, that we call the φ failure detector. The particularity of the φ failure detector is that it dynamically adjusts to current network conditions the scale on which the suspicion level is expressed. We analyzed the behavior of our φ failure detector over an intercontinental communication link during several days. Our experimental results show that our φ failure detector performs equally well as other known adaptive failure detection mechanisms, with an improved flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dhuqig/accrual_failure_detector","submitter_user":{"username":"epilys","created_at":"2017-05-09T09:29:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"epilys@libera.chat #lobsters\r\n\r\ngeneral interest link aggregator (lobste.rs but not computing focused) https://tade.link \r\n\r\nMastodon: https://chaos.social/@epilys\r\nhttps://github.com/epilys\r\n\r\nmeli terminal mail client https://meli.delivery","is_moderator":false,"karma":1025,"avatar_url":"/avatars/epilys-100.png","invited_by_user":"river","github_username":"epilys"},"tags":["compsci","distributed","pdf"]},{"short_id":"1nd8x6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1nd8x6","created_at":"2022-01-08T07:16:05.000-06:00","title":"The History of Prince of Persia (2010)","url":"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/18/ign-presents-the-history-of-prince-of-persia","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1nd8x6/history_prince_persia_2010","submitter_user":{"username":"susam","created_at":"2020-04-29T15:40:43.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Ardent user of Debian, Firefox, and Emacs.\r\n\r\nDeveloper of [TeXMe](https://github.com/susam/texme), [Muboard](https://github.com/susam/muboard), and [Uncap](https://github.com/susam/uncap).\r\n\r\nPosting about C, Python, Lisp, TeX, Emacs, Linux, information security, mathematics, etc.\r\n\r\nMy shell prompt on Fridays: `PS1=$(printf \"\\\\w\\xf0\\x9f\\x8d\\xba  \")`","is_moderator":false,"karma":1296,"avatar_url":"/avatars/susam-100.png","invited_by_user":"premysl","github_username":"susam","twitter_username":"susam"},"tags":["games"]},{"short_id":"ltm6qx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ltm6qx","created_at":"2022-01-08T15:06:06.000-06:00","title":"Increasing the performance of elm-css","url":"https://blogg.bekk.no/increasing-the-performance-of-elm-css-34075512d6a6","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ltm6qx/increasing_performance_elm_css","submitter_user":{"username":"rvt","created_at":"2019-09-19T15:00:46.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Hi, I'm Rijnard.

However, there is plenty of evidence that companies will not pay for what software they use until they realize that there is a problem, such as log4j, OpenSSL, and probably plenty others.\nThen there are the cases where companies are outright violating licenses such as the violations of the GPL with regards to OBS Studio by TikTok, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, of course, Copilot might be used to launder code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves me with the impression that companies will not pay if they can get away with it, and getting away with it might even include breaking the law since the little guy does not have resources to sue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there seems to be a glimmer of hope: copyleft licenses with the option for companies to purchase a commercial license. (This is an option for me because I’m writing the code from scratch.) Based on some previous comments on the orange site (like \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29524103\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e), it seems that even this may not work, which would be sad. But I thought I would ask here before I throw in the towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address things like Qt, obviously, dual licensing makes money for companies because if they dual license their stuff, other companies will pay because they are afraid of being sued be someone with enough resources to win. But as I alluded to above, that’s not really the case for an individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I would like to hear your thoughts and experiences about using copyleft with commercial licenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes dual licensing work? Do companies pay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way, by “effective,” I don’t mean that every company follows the license. All I want is for just enough of them to purchase a license and/or support to pay 2 times the typical developer salary. (I need 2 times the salary for tax purposes.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I also have a meta-question: when companies violate licenses, how often are they just bluffing? Is serving them with a lawsuit enough?
